## Take Aways

Template: `- **The brilliant idea** within a bigger sentence ([./dayN/filename.md](T# S#))`

- Consider the non-standard browsers: **KaiOS and Facebook Mobile Browser** ([Tx.S1 Keynote](./day1/keynote.md))
- **Only include package dependencies that you need.** Use tools to profile which packages are too big and other tools for page load stats ([T1.S4 Webpack Performance Trickery](./day1/Webpack%20Performance%20Trickery.md))
- **Debug with Chrome [Remote Devices](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging)** ([T2.S5 How to Build Better Tutorials with Mixed Reality](How%20to%20Build%20Better%20Tutorials%20with%20Mixed%20Reality%20(T1%20S5).md))
- **Measure PWAs on good perceived metrics** not just popular metrics ([T1.S6 How to Build the Fastest PWA](Fastest%20PWA%20(T1%20S6).md))
- Tons of Client-Side Storage options, but must keep in mind that **Client-Side data is mutable and can NOT be trusted**. ([T1.S2 Client-Side Data Storage](./day2/Client-Side%20Data%20Storage%20(T1%20S2).md))
- **App --> PWA: Shifting the nature of problems** ([T2.S4 Why Every App Should be a PWA](./day2/Make%20It%20A%20PWA%20(T2%20S4).md))
  - Platform compatibility --> Browser (and minor browser) compatibility
  - App size --> Time to meaningful paint, smart prefetching logic
  - Secured mobile state --> Ensure the local state is tamperproof
- Use **Code Splitting for PWAs** and web ([T2.S4 Why Every App Should be a PWA](./day2/Make%20It%20A%20PWA%20(T2%20S4).md))

- **Run a quick package scan on our packages** ([T1.S4 Webpack Performance Trickery](./day1/Webpack%20Performance%20Trickery%20(T1%20S3).md))
- Will (when will?) Apple allow PWAs on their store?
