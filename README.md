## Take Aways

Template: `- **The brilliant idea** within a bigger sentence ([./dayN/filename.md](T# S#))`

- Consider the non-standard browsers: **KaiOS and Facebook Mobile Browser** ([Tx.S1 Keynote](./day1/keynote.md))

- **Debug with Chrome [Remote Devices](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/remote-debugging)** ([T2.S5 How to Build Better Tutorials with Mixed Reality](How%20to%20Build%20Better%20Tutorials%20with%20Mixed%20Reality%20(T1%20S5).md))
