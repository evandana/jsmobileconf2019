# Fostering DevOps Culture - Diana Rodriguez
### What is DevOps?

- Increases collaboration between the roles of development and operations
- _See Vue.js Docs for a nice description_

### DevOps/Industry Culture
- Fosters a culture of "firefighters, rockstars, ninjas and superheroes"
- Firefighters, fightning the fires that get shipped
- "Swoop in, fix it quick"
- We **should** be working on processes, architecture, etc. instead of being saviors at the last minute
- The ideal is a "quiet house": Predictability, no surprises, we're all in the same ship!
### How do we achieve better?
- Think of the future, work for *tomorrow* instead of yesterday, or at best, today
- How do you know if you're improving, if you're not measuring? "Whatever performance not informed and not measured, doesn't exist."
- DevOps is about *feedback* and *faster time to feedback*

### How do you gain feedback?

- Why are you shipping an update? Performance? Bug fixing? UX improvements?
- How are you measuring the effectiveness - user satisfaction? crash count? analytics?

### Shockers - State of the Industry

- 48% of customers, and 10% of developers, think IoT devices have the "necessary security in place"
- 49% of customers don't trust their personal/private data to IoT, but use them anyway
- 85% of developers have felt rushed to get an application to market due to demand/pressure in the last 6 minutes
- "We are shipping the fires we have to put out!"

> This is what DevOps culture is about - communication for the sake of helping managers, marketing analysts, budget owners, etc. understand the risk and cost of not collaborating, training, acquiring knowledge, and improving processes.

### It's Time for a Change

- Not looking to start a revolution, don't show up and tell your boss "No!"

- But, do have the uncomfortable (but honest) conversation about pain points and gaps in understanding

- Sometimes, part of the solution is to take time off!

- "Junior" vs. "Senior" is BS, you're either a developer or you're not, and you always know *some* things, and don't know *way more things*

  > There's a human component - celebrate your successess, cry your failures, and ask for help.
